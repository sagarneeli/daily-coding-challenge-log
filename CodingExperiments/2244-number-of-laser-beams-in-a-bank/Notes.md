### Complexity Analysis

Here, M is the number of strings in the bank and N is the average length of the strings.

#### Time complexity: O(M∗N)

We have to iterate over each character once to find the number of safety devices in each row and hence the time complexity is equal to O(M∗N)).

#### Space complexity: O(1)

We only need three variables prev, ans and count and hence the space complexity is constant.
