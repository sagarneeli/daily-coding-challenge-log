<h2>number-of-laser-beams-in-a-bank Notes</h2><hr>Complexity Analysis

Here, MMM is the number of strings in the bank and NNN is the average length of the strings.

Time complexity: O(M∗N)O(M * N)O(M∗N)

We have to iterate over each character once to find the number of safety devices in each row and hence the time complexity is equal to O(M∗N)O(M * N)O(M∗N).

Space complexity: O(1)O(1)O(1)

We only need three variables prev, ans and count and hence the space complexity is constant.
